Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! This repository contains my solutions to the challenges presented in Advent of Code 2023, all implemented in Golang.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of coding puzzles released each day leading up to Christmas. These challenges cover various algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques, making it an exciting opportunity to sharpen coding skills and have some fun!

## Structure

Each day's challenge has its own folder named according to the day (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.). Inside each folder, you'll find:

- `main.go`: Golang source code containing the solution for the respective day's challenge.
- `input.txt`: Input data specific to that day's problem.

## Running the Solutions

To run any solution, navigate to the respective day's folder and execute the Golang code. For example:

```bash
cd day01
go run main.go
```

## Disclaimer

These solutions are provided as my own interpretations of the Advent of Code challenges. They might not be the most optimized or efficient solutions, but I've aimed for readability and correctness.

Feel free to explore, learn, and compare solutions. If you have any suggestions or improvements, I'm open to feedback and contributions!

Happy coding and best of luck with Advent of Code 2023ðŸŽ„!
